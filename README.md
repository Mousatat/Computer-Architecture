# Computer-Architecture-Labs
This repository for Computer-Architecture course which include labs and homeworks from Innopolis university bachelor degree first year Fall semester 2020

The course covers the fundamental principles of computer systems design. We first overview the key hardware components of a modern computer system, available performance metrics, and the general principles of computer architecture. We then discuss the representation and execution of computer instructions, instruction set architecture, the translation hierarchy of a high-level program into machine code. We also cover the elements of computer arithmetics, logic circuits, including combinational and sequential logic circuits. These theoretical principles are illustrated by using MIPS instruction set architecture, FPGA, and Verilog HDL programming language during the labs. We then study in details simple and pipelined implementation schemes of a processor, the idea of a pipelined execution, related hazards and their solutions. We complete the course by introducing several advanced topics, including computer security and vulnerabilities, GPU programming, and modern principles for memory hierarchy design.
